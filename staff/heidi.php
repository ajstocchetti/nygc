<p>Heidi Shea Springer, AICP, joined New York Grant Company in 2013, after 13 years in progressively responsible roles overseeing programs and staff of the New York City Industrial Development at the New York City Economic Development Agency (NYCEDC).</p>
<p>While at NYCEDC, Heidi assisted scores of companies, not-for-profits and developers to access discretionary tax incentives and bond financing programs, as well as-of-right benefit programs offered by New York City and State to promote growth across all business sectors and economic growth throughout the five boroughs. Heidi is a certified planner and earned a Master of Urban Planning from Columbia University, as well as Bachelors’ degrees in Urban Planning and Sociology from Arizona State University.</p>
<p>Heidi is an advocate for businesses of all types and sizes that are seeking to grow and invest in their businesses. While at NYCEDC, she successfully negotiated discretionary benefit agreements with over 30 companies, netting the City commitments for 35,000 jobs, over $3 billion in private investment and the over 3 million square feet of commercial development. After 9/11, Heidi implemented the City’s Recovery Zone Program, which provided critical access to federal capital allowing key development projects to proceed when liquidity in the financial markets evaporated. </p>
<p>Heidi’s experience ranges from working with large multi-nationals establish headquarters and back-office operations; to not-for profits seeking new offices and program locations; to retail and super market development; to assisting family-run industrial companies to acquire or enter into long-term leases. A proponent of the industrial sector in NYC, Heidi assisted in the redevelopment of the one million square foot Federal Building in the Brooklyn waterfront to ensure industrial companies have access to new state-of the-art space for years to come. Heidi has also cultivated strong relationships in the City’s leading industrial areas including Williamsburg/Greenpoint, South Brooklyn, Long Island City and the South Bronx. </p>
<p>Prior to serving the City, Heidi worked for REIS Reports, a real estate services firm, reporting commercial real estate markets across the US on providing data on individual investment properties. Heidi also worked at the International Council of Shopping Centers, reporting on retail sales, development trends, and economic data impacting the retail industry.</p>
