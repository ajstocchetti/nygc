<p>A large digital communications corporation moved its facility from Chelsea in Manhattan to Brooklyn, investing over $10 million in building renovations and transferring more than 500 workers. The company was dubious about its ability to receive any economic assistance from the government. NYGC succeeded in realizing over $26 million in as-of-right incentives for the company, including 12 years of business income tax credits, 5 years of rent credits, 12 years of electricity discounts, and permanent exemption from occupancy tax. We are now pursuing additional benefits for this same facility and the total package is likely to be $40-50 million.</p>
