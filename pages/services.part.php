<h1>Everything We Do</h1>
<h3>We do it for you</h3>
<p>The New York Grant Company knows the incentives that are available to you, and we will work through the entire process. We’re focused on maximizing your incentives, while deftly navigating all rules and opportunities. Economic incentives are our core business, and when it comes to finding incentives, applying, and getting approval for your business or organization we’re the best in our field.</p>
<p>But why use our services? Getting incentives is not the primary business of your real estate agent (or lawyer, or accountant, or whomever). They don't know the landscape (or care) the way we do. <span class="standout">Incentives is what we do.</span> Other types of professionals may be able to give you a small part of the picture, or assist you with some aspect of the process. Unless you have a full-service, dedicated team of incentive experts on your side, applying for incentives on your own can be daunting, and opportunities may be forfeited.</p>
<p>The New York Grant Company can apply for benefits in the most cost effective way possible, saving your company time, money and hassle. What is more, we will not miss program dollars that are on the table for you.</p>
